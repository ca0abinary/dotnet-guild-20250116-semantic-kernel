- You will still need to install and start [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

## Notebooks

- `01_GettingStarted.ipynb`
  - A gentle start using Ollama to host a local LLM instance and a small amount of .net code to perform a simple request response to the LLM.
  - We start by installing the NuGet packages, downloading the appropriate models, and finish by learning the answer to life, the universe, and everything.
- `02_ChatHistory.ipynb`
  - Learn about the `ChatHistory` class and how the LLM understands the back and forth nature of your interactions.
- `03_FunctionCalling.ipynb`
  - Learn how to have the model automatically call custom functions!
  - âš  Currently this functionality is only available in the C# project due to issues with Polyglot Notebooks.
- `04_VectorSearch.ipynb`
  - We will dig into the fundamentals of creating a vector store
  - See how information can be retrieved using natural language limited to a very exact data set
- `05_FormattedOutput.ipynb`
  - Use the language model to generate Json formatted data
  - We will create a simple fantasy novel character generator with a consistent data schema
